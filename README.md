# TopNotchPhysiqueProgramatically
A sample front end UI for a social media app. 
A user can navigate various UIViewControllers using a UITabBarController and UINavigationControllers. 
The feed is a UITableViewController with custom UITableViewCells.
Everything in post is embbedded in a UIScrollView. The UITextView has two observors using NotificationCenter that will push all content in the UIScrollView up or down by the size of the keyboard when the UITextView is first responder. Users can add content using a UITapGestureRecognizer where a UIImagePickerController allows users to add photos or videos from their library. 
Throughout the app UIImageViews, UILabels, and UIButtons are implemented. 
Everything is done programatically without use of storyboard.
